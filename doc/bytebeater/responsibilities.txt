Structure of the bytebeater
===========================

Setup
-----
The Setup function which will set up all hardware, timers, and peripherals. Setup is also responsible for reading the interface on startup in order to enter special modes. These modes might include a debugging mode, different timer prescalers, silent mode, etc. The mode selection is done by holding down buttons during startup.

Interface loop
--------------
The interface loop is the main loop that the microcontroller will be executing. This loop will poll the interface elements and react according to the interface input.The interface elements will include all methods of user input, that is all the sensors, buttons, the keyboard, and connections to other devices. The reactions to the changes and values of the interface elements will be modifying the beat context, writing to output peripherals like the display, and reading data from external memory. The interface loop implements the user interface that is wanted on the device.

The timer interrupt service routine
-----------------------------------
On hardware level the timer ISR is responsible for generating the PWM audio signal. The timer will define a maximum samplerate and a smallest unit of time. On software level the timer is responsible for modifying the time variables 't' in the beat context according to the velocity variables.
The timer ISR will also call the beat context evaluation routine. Calling the evaluation routine will not be done every time the interrups fires, but only those times when the time variables 't' change. There is simply no need to evaluate the context faster than the fastest time variable. The context is constantly being changed by the user and the timer, but the timer will be changing the context much faster than the user. The timer might increment 't' 8000 times a second, while the analog controls are changed byt he user only tens of times a second.

The beat context
----------------
The beat context is responsible for containing all the global data that needs to be available for all the other routines.
